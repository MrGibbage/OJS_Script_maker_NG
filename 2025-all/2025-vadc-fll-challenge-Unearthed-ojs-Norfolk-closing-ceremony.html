<p><i>The Emcee can announce each team as they move through a line of volunteers to receive their tournament ribbons. You might want to funnel them into a "reserved for teams" seating area in the stands.</i></p>

<p>We started this tournament with a shared mission: to innovate, to learn, and to celebrate the UNEARTHED season. Every single team brought something special, and we've seen amazing robots, brilliant solutions, and above all, incredible teamwork. Today, each of you has embodied the values of FIRST LEGO League - discovery, impact, inclusion, innovation, teamwork, and fun!</p>

<p>Teams - Congratulations on a great season! The journey that got you to this point defines each one of you as a FIRST LEGO League champion and winner, and this tournament ribbon celebrates this achievement.</p>

<p>We want to thank our FIRST LEGO League Global Sponsors, LEGO Education and The LEGO Foundation.  We also want to say a big thank you to our tournament sponsors; James Madison University's Division of Research, Economic Development, and Innovation.</p>

<p>Before we get to the team awards, we want to take a moment to recognize our volunteers. Volunteers - please stand and wave to the crowd! Teams - please give a round of applause for our volunteers. No words can adequately express our appreciation for you.</p>

<p>No tournament can happen without the support, time, and commitment of our volunteers. At every tournament, there are those individuals who are the “go-to” people, the “make it happen” people. Our first award goes to just such a person - a person who really went above and beyond to make this tournament a success.</p>

<h2>Coach Recognition</h2>
<p>Coaches and mentors, please stand. These are the special volunteers who have spent hours each week with the teams. They have inspired, encouraged, and motivated, all the while demonstrating and modeling <i>Gracious Professionalism</i><sup>&#174;</sup>. Teams, take a moment to tell your coaches how much you appreciate all they have done for you.</p>
